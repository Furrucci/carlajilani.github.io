							<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>About Me:</strong> Hi, my name is Carla Jilani, and I’m currently a full-time student at RMIT. I had previously been working in the ‘Banking and Finance’ sector which I really enjoyed and am working to further my career in this field by advancing my qualifications in the area of financial planning. I really enjoy money management and have big aspirations to develop and expand educational services and social reforms in this area. It is a rather large goal I have set for myself, and whilst I don’t have all the finer details worked out just yet, somethings you just need to begin and figure the rest out along the way - as the Chinese proved says: “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.”</p>

							<h2>Interest in Information Technology and Study</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Interest in I.T:</strong> I’m interested in I.T. as it effects essentially every area of our lives these days, both professionally and personally. I use technology (my desktop and smartphone) for basically everything I do and rely on it heavily for work. My interest in IT began primarily through my experience in the banking and finance sector as nearly every aspect of the job relies on the use of IT and access to the internet in order to perform the role effectively. Knowing how to utilise financial software and applications as well as accessing a multitude of investment platforms online is a critical element of the occupation and virtually impossible to conduct  without the use of IT. There’s not necessarily one event in particular but rather a multitude of events involving the use of financial software to conduct my role as a Paraplanner that sparked my interest and desire to improve my IT knowledge and skill as I found in my experience as a Paraplanner - cliches, bugs, software errors and incapabilities were frequent thus hindering efficiency within internal processes.</p>
							<p>I chose to study with RMIT as they are one of the few Universities offering new degrees within the area of Financial Planning. Due to recent industry reforms, financial planning degrees are relatively new, with not all universities offering these courses yet. In addition to offering this degree via external studies (online), RMIT in conjunction with Open Universities Australia (OUA) offer four study periods a year, making the study load more manageable. RMIT is also one of Australia’s better ranked universities, making it a competitive and attractive option when comparing educational providers.</p>
							<p>In addition to expanding my knowledge in the relevant subjects studied, I hope/expect to learn valuable skills that will be versatile and applicable particularly within a workplace setting giving me a better understanding of how software works, and perhaps a nifty trick or two, to help resolve future I.T. challenges - helping me to become a high value asset to employers within the financial planning industry.<p>

							<h2>Ideal Career</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Ideal Position:</strong> My ideal career is to continue my progression in the banking and financial services industry as a paraplanner, one day advancing to the level of ‘Senior Paraplanner’. A Paraplanner is a supportive role to senior financial advisers. The position incorporates the collection of client data, preparation and creation of financial planning documentation specifically ‘Statement of Advice’ (SoA). Their job is to ensure the advice given in the document is clear, concise and accurate. These documents are produced via the use of financial software such as XPlan, COIN and Midwinter. Paraplanner’s work closely with the financial adviser, collaborating to develop effective financial strategies to assist the client in achieving their goals and objectives. Further responsibilities include: Generating reports, Financial modelling, Maintaining client files, Communicating with clients, Liaising with Platform managers, business development managers and other industry professionals, Assisting with investment and superannuation transactions, Scheduling client meetings on behalf of the Financial Adviser, Maintaining relevant industry knowledge and training to meet compliance requirements. What is appealing about this position is that whilst there is some client contact, it is limited and not as heavily involved as a client service officer’s role, therefore allowing for more attention on maintaining client files, research and the creation of SoAs. In addition, I like creating and producing something (SoAs and reports) in a financial planning context. It combines both creative and analytical elements whilst strengthening my financial knowledge. It is a position that pays well in the right location, offering opportunities for further career progression and development.</p>
							<p>The skills required to be a Paraplanner can vary across different firms, businesses, and organisations, as the Financial Advisers they assist will require different tasks and focus from their Paraplanners. Nevertheless, there are some core financial planning skills that all Paraplanners will be required to perform to a lessor or greater extent - being as follows:
Excellent communication skills (Verbal and written)
Excellent report writing skills
High attention to detail
Ability to analyse statistics
Aptitude to conduct research for appropriate providers and investments
Good understanding of compliance issues
Efficient time management and organisational skills
Excellent interpersonal and IT skills<p>
	<p>The qualification and experience required for Paraplanners across the board are not the same as what they are for Financial Advisers, giving them some exemptions as stated within ASIC’s RG146. However, due to recent legislative changes within the industry resulting from the global financial crisis (GFC), the bar has been set quite high raising the minimum standard for industry relevant qualifications for those providing financial services and advice. These changes have been made in an attempt to ‘clean up the industry’ and restore consumer confidence in the Banking, Finance and Insurance sector. Whilst most of the reforms are applicable to Financial Advisers, many Licensees now require Paraplanners to have the same level of qualifications as the advisers; this is in-part to raise the quality of their organisation and the employees within, but it’s also a natural career progression for many Paraplanners to advance to an Advisory role. As noted in the job advertisement attached above, it is a requirement that the applicant have a Business degree majoring in either Financial Planning/Advising, Finance, Commerce or Economics.  Given the position advertised is for a ‘Graduate Paraplanner’ the employer does not require the applicant to have financial planning experience in this instance, rather they are looking for a graduate of which to mentor and provide full training during the course of the applicant’s development. The title ‘Paraplanner’ is used broadly across all levels and capabilities within the position, however as the industry continues to grow and the roles within it evolve, there are different levels of experience that can categorise the expertise of Paraplanners as follows:
Graduate / Junior / Support Paraplanner: 1-2 years experience - requiring Certificate in Financial Planning
Paraplanner (Intermediate): 3-5 years experience - Diploma Financial Planning
Senior Paraplanner: 5+ years experience - Diploma of Financial Planning / Advanced Diploma of Financial Planning / Certified Financial Planner
Associate Financial Adviser / Paraplanner: 7+ years experience - Diploma of Financial Planning / Advanced Diploma of Financial Planning / Certified Financial Planner / Relevant Degree / Graduate Diploma / Masters Degree<p>
	<p>Prior to commencing study I had been working in the financial planning industry, first as a client service officer which gave me experience with understanding the basic financial advisory process, from initial client meeting and data gathering, determining the client goals identifying the appropriate strategy and products necessary to help the client achieve those goals, and then the implementation and application of those strategies. After this I went on to become a Paraplanner with another Financial Planning business, I really enjoyed this role as I got to develop my skills and knowledge further, particularly in the area of financial modelling and document preparation in the form of Statement of Advice (SoA), Portfolio reviews, amongst other reports. During my time in this role I got further experience with the utilisation of XPlan, which is financial planning and wealth management software used by advice firms of all sizes, and is relied on heavily to produce complete and compliant financial advice documents and service. Given the expansive and complex nature of many financial products today, financial businesses could not effectively conduct business without it. So to get this experience and learn to navigate the software is highly valuable to my future candidacy in the industry. As such, my experience within the industry so far has allowed me to develop and expand a multitude of skills such as the following: strong interpersonal skills, analytical skills, organisational skills, as well as technical skills.<p>
<p>My plan to obtain a position like the one advertised above is to successfully complete my Bachelor of Business majoring in Financial Planning with RMIT. This qualification will allow me to meet the ‘New Entrant’ requirements set by FASEA and ASIC. Combining my exposure, insight and experience within the industry with this qualification in addition to my pre-exisiting Diploma in Financial Planning will make me a strong candidate for future ‘Graduate Paraplanner’ positions.<p>

										<h3>Personality:</h3>
										<p>Introverted - Sensing - Thinking - Judging (ISTJ)</p>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p><strong>Personality Tests:</strong> In relation to my personality traits, I’ve always felt as though I have a relatively high level of self awareness, recognising my own behaviours both good and bad rather innately. However, in spite of how I see myself, this will likely be different to how others view me, so in order to gain a better non-biased assessment of these characteristics I took the following personality tests: a free version of the Myer-Briggs test online at ‘Psychcentral’, Learning Styles test via ‘North Carolina State University' online, and an IQ test via ‘MyPersonality’. Collectively I would agree with most of the results, however there were some aspects I found interesting and surprising. The Myer-Briggs version described me having stronger tendencies for Introverted - Sensing - Thinking - Judging (ISTJ), ranking highest in ‘Thinking’ which I would agree with. I find myself thinking extensively, frequently analysing a particular subject that I may be focused on at that time. The Learning Style test ranked me highest in the areas of Sensing and Sequential, meaning I’m most apt to learning via facts and solving problems via well-established methods with a dislike for complications and surprises. Again, I would agree with this description as I like clearly defined methods, having a preference for linear steps having a natural inclination to favour logical sequential stepwise paths. Lastly, the IQ test, I found interesting and a little surprising as it described I have a higher score in the left-brain region. In school I had always had a stronger dominance with right-brain subjects, with natural tendencies for creativity. However, according to the IQ summary I have a strong grasp on both basic and advanced logical concept (left-brain), but will not perform as well in relation to tasks that require creativity (right-brain). On the contrary, the overall score described me as being in the ‘Bright range of intelligence’, which was a pleasing result.<p>
											<p>According to the IQ test I perform well when constructing arguments and following through ideas to their logical conclusion - this in-conjunction with the Myer-Briggs findings that I am thorough, responsible, dependable and hard working will no doubt prove beneficial in a group setting. In contrast however, the Myer-Briggs also defined myself as slightly more introverted, thus I perceive I may not take on dominant leadership type roles within a group, instead taking a more passive role but will still be an active participant. This is not necessarily a negative, although if the information is presented in a back n’ forth manner, I may get lost. I would agree with this as my experience in financial planning, unexpected tasks would popup frequently requiring immediate attention thus disrupting my ‘planned’ steps for the day, so this may prove challenging for me in a group setting/team environment. The IQ test suggested I focus more energy into increasing my creativity thus making me a better problem solver for existing and unexpected events.<p>
												<p>Considering all this in the context of working within a team, I need to be aware that not everybody will like a clearly marked plan, following a sequential pathway, and may prefer a more creative and spontaneous approach with different levels of input. Whilst it is important to consider the needs and methods of teammates, it is also relevant to understand how I perform best to enable an effective contribution to the group objective/consensus so good communication and adaptability I believe will assist with this in addition to finding compatible personalities and work ethics where possible.<p>

										<h3>Project Idea</h3>
										<p>Additional Description if needed goes here.</p>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<div class="content">
											<p><strong>Overview:</strong> The project I had in mind was to build upon and improve the educational element imbedded within a software program that already exists and is widely used across the financial services industry, known as Xplan. Xplan is a comprehensive web-based client data and wealth management software system that is developed by an Australian technological company Iress. Whilst Xplan does offer instructional step-by-step documents that sit alongside their suite of software when purchased, it is essentially presented in an ad hoc format. I’d like to build upon this creating a more structured and interactive format outlining the sequential progression from absolute beginner through to intermediate and advanced levels.<p>
											<p><strong>Motivation:</strong>	The motivation to create a more structured and comprehensive delivery of the educational aspects of Xplan is a result of my own experience trying to learn how to use this software with no training when based in a regional area. Iress and some licensed providers of Xplan do offer live workshops, where users can gain more hands-on experience with a facilitator on-hand to assist, these workshops are restricted to metropolitan areas only, therefore inaccessible to users based outside of the capital cities. In an effort to address this issue for users located in regional areas basic videos and online seminars have been offered in addition to the written instructional documents (largely in PDF format) within Xplan itself. From my experience I found this approach not as effective as it could be as I wouldn’t know where to begin, often struggling to find the relevant information to a specific tasks particularly in the area of troubleshooting. As clear and straightforward as the PDF’s and online videos were, they did not cater for unexpected ‘error’ messages that would popup whilst entering data or generating reports etc. I found the live webinar were of a ‘watch n’ listen’ nature with limited opportunity to ask questions at the end of the session thus not being much more helpful. Therefore, when I was new to the industry and unfamiliar with the software I struggled to know where to begin and how to work my way through the learning material provided as there was no explanation or indication of what direction to follow the material in. Given my issue of location, any one-to-one assistance was limited and difficult to arrange due to office demands on both ends and time constraints during the calls.<p>
											<p><strong>Description:</strong> I believe by packaging the PDF’s and correlating videos into a structured sequential program such as Introductory beginners (Level 1), Intermediate (Level 2), Advanced (Level3), with each level containing a developmental plan (for e.g. 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 etc), with each section being a prerequisite for the next level, will allow users to gain a better understanding of how to navigate to the learning material and measure their skill progression throughout. This can be delivered via an online Asynchronous Self-paced Learning Management System (LMS) which will incorporate interactive software that directs and prompts the user when entering data as they work through each section of the material.<p>
												<p>The program will also include an educational platform such as discussion boards and instant messenger chat rooms that will allow users to engage and ask questions with other users, course facilitators and industry professionals in real time. This will allow users of all different experience levels to share their knowledge, tips and tricks with others, making for a more collaborative and efficient distribution of education.<p>
													<p>There will also be an option for designated online tutoring sessions and workshops to provide on-hand experience for users unable to attend the live workshops offered in metropolitan areas. These should be scheduled for regular weekly sessions just as they are for in-person workshops, the only difference is that they are scheduled online of which users can log onto via video and web conferencing cloud platforms such as Zoom or Skype whilst simultaneously accessing the Xplan software to coincide with the topics being discusses at hand. These expansions and additions will work to integrate several different learning styles such as: visual, audio, active kinaesthetic, and analytical.<p>
														<p>By expanding upon the instructional PDF’s, accompanying tutorial videos, and live webinar sessions and packaging them into a interactive structured educational industry specific course that incorporates online live workshops and tailored tutoring sessions, I believe will create and deliver a much more comprehensive and effective teaching mechanism not only raising the educational standard but also the quality of it’s users and recipients. Given that Iress’s software is currently used by more than 9,000 businesses and 500,000 users globally, forming and an integral tool to the financial planning industry. The possible flow on effect of more efficient systems could be exponential.<p>
													<p><strong>Tool and Technology:</strong> To bring this idea to fruition, I would present the concept to the current developer and provider of Xplan software: Iress and collaborate with their ‘Iress Labs’ department (whose purpose is a collaborative software design approach with its users), and work with Iress Lab’s technicians, to formulate ways to design and incorporate Asynchronous LMS with video and web conferencing cloud platforms into their current centralised data and wealth management system and platform. The possibility to collaborate with one of the industries leading education and qualification providers ‘Kaplan Professional’ would also be considered for the possibility to integrate an online examination software portal which can provide a service to Iress. The examination program will be customisable, offering dual users - admin and normal users. Admin being the facilitators and tutors that will be able to make additions and customise the examinations for their users. This will assist the users to gage their development and assess their progress throughout the course, giving them a clear indication of their skill level in relation to job and career prospects within the Financial Services Industry.<p>
													<p><strong>Skills Required:</strong> In order to bring this project to fruition good communication and persuasion skills will be a must to engage and convince these companies and individuals to collaborate on brining this idea into a tangible and saleable service/product. In relation to the I.T. technicians and software engineers, a collection of skills will be needed such as: Computer programming and Coding skills, Software development, Object-orientated design (OOD), Software testing and debugging skills, Problem solving and logical thinking, as well as creativity, dedication, organisation and collaborative skills.<p>
														<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> If I were successful in my pursuits to formulate and create a comprehensive education program - built specifically for the financial planning sector encompassing Xplan - would be beneficial to the financial services industry as a whole. I have no doubt that it would be widely welcomed and accepted particularly by users in areas where access to relevant resources are limited or simply inaccessible. By offering a much more cohesive delivery system that is measurable and incorporates several different learning styles will not only make it easier and more effective for the users, but I believe it will also assist in uplifting the efficiency and quality of not only the documents and reports being produced, but the overall productivity of the business which are the recipients of the users utilising this software, therefore leading to better products and services to the consumers of the financial services industry.<p>
